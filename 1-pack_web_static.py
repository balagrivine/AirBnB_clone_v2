"""
Write a Fabric script that generates a .tgz archive from the contents of the web_static folder of your AirBnB Clone repo, using the function do_pack.

Prototype: def do_pack():
    All files in the folder web_static must be added to the final archive
    All archives must be stored in the folder versions (your function should create this folder if it doesnâ€™t exist)
    The name of the archive created must be web_static_<year><month><day><hour><minute><second>.tgz
    The function do_pack must return the archive path if the archive has been correctly generated. Otherwise, it should return None
